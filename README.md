# TCPIPbridge
QT and Django app exposing REST api

TCPIPbridge offers a tcp-ip interface to help extend the functionality of [Isadora](https://troikatronix.com "The creativity server").
The supported functions are offered via http GET.

Current features:
1.  Launch (open application)
2.  Close (close Launched application)
3.  DisplayCIF (capture any system display as a file)

The Web application opens as a QT window displaying the Django project.
Documention is built into the webapp interface.

Currently this project has a complex enviroment to build. 
The next step is to create a virtual env for this project to simplify setup.

A Isadora sample project will be provided with TCP-IP communications demostrated.
